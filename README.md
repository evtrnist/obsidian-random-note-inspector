# Random Note Inspector

Randomly selects a note from your vault to review or clean up.
Each note is shown once per cycle — no repeats until all notes are inspected.

## Usage
- Open Command Palette
- Run **Inspect random note**

## How it works
- Notes are shuffled into a cycle
- Each command picks the next note
- Progress is saved between restarts
